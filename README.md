## About The Project

Snowball is a low-weight, dynamically typed, object oriented programming language with garbage collector and module system.

Features:
* Object oriented programming
* It is memory safe
* Built-in functions for better productions
* Faster than other programming languages
* Garbage collector
* Unit testing

It has a lot more features that can be explored! You can check them out in the [documentation]().

## How does snowball feel?

Here is an example of a class in snowball.

```rs
import System

class Vector {

    priv Int x;
    priv Int y;

    pub fn __init(self, x: Int, y: Int) {
        self.x, self.y = x, y;        
    }
    
    // JS equivalent: const __sum = (this, vec2) => new Vector(...)
    // overrides operator +
    pub fn __sum(self, vec2: Vector) -> Vector = 
        new Vector(self.x + vec2.x, self.y + vec2.y)
    
    pub fn __str(self) -> String {
        return "Vector(x=${self.x} y=${self.y})"
    }
}

fn main(args: Array<String>) -> Int {
    let vec1 = new Vector(1,2)
    let vec2 = new Vector(10,22)
    
    System.print(vec1 + vec2)
    return 0
}
```
