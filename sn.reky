# Reky's project dependencies!
# This file contains your project's dependencies. For more information, refer
# to the documentation: https://snowball-lang.gitbook.io/docs/reky/getting-started
#
# Any changes done to this file will be reflected in the next build. Note that 
# removing a dependency will not remove it from the project, you will need to
# manually remove it from the project's build path or run `snowball clean`.
